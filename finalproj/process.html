        <h2>Inspiration & Ideation</h2>
        <p>
            The group was interested in exploring music trends specifically relating to how generations of users can influence the music charts and dictate which types of music or artists become ‘mainstream’ and popular through mass streaming practices. Our initial idea was to take a deeper look and analyze music trends through Spotify, and further take these datasets and compare them with data from Billboard Hot 100s to get a more holistic outlook of the music industry, and the streaming activities of users for both of these music streaming platforms.        </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inadequate visualization for the 2nd task. The comparison between the years 2013-2023 do not provide enough insight as to exactly how much Gen Zs and Millennial’s music taste has changed.</li>
            <li>Datasets for the visualizations had to be researched and pieced together manually as no one dataset covered all of the necessary data and information needed for the visualizations, therefore the team needed to manually synthesize and combine data form different sources to create one dataset for each visualization.</li>
            <li>The current visualizations are still rough ideas which means the team needs to iterate further and discuss what types of visualizations are appropriate for certain datasets to create a more effective display of the data that we want to present.</li>
