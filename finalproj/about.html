        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            These visualizations will narrate a story that unpacks the trends from the past decade regarding the changing preferences in music. Data from Spotify and Billboard Hot 100s will be used to create visualizations that tell the story of how music tastes have changed or stayed similar each year, and what contributing factors are present, specifically focusing on the user demographics of Spotify. Data such as music streams for songs and artists, user demographics, and song/artist ranking will be cross-referenced with the same data retrieved from the Billboard Hot 100s to examine for similarities or differences in the top ranking music genres, songs, and artists for each year from 2014 to 2023.

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The goal of this visualization is to observe and analyze trends in music streaming platforms within the past decade. This is to determine the influence of media and recent pop culture on the rankings of top streamed songs, as well as to provide insights into what type of music are in demand for the general public – to create more informed decision-making for artists when producing new music.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How well do <b>well-known artists</b> perform on streaming services <b>compared</b> to <b>lesser known artists</b> (non-mainstream or other types of niche music genre)?
            </li>
            <li>
                Checking whether there is a <b>correlation to the rise of certain artists</b> in the charts and <i>decline or disappearance</i> of <b>certain music genres</b> – influenced by pop culture and media (mainstream songs/artists vs. lesser known artists/niche music genres)
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
                <b>Insights</b> on what different user-base <b>want</b> out of Spotify in terms of genres of music, and how <b>Spotify’s music rankings compare to Billboard’s Hot 100 songs</b> over the past decade.
            </li>
