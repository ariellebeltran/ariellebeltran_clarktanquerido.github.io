        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>These visualizations will narrate a story that unpacks the trends from the past decade regarding the changing preferences in music. Data from Spotify and Billboard Hot 100s will be used to create visualizations that tell the story of how music tastes have changed or stayed similar each year, and what contributing factors are present, specifically focusing on the user demographics of Spotify. Data such as music streams for songs and artists, user demographics, and song/artist ranking will be cross-referenced with the same data retrieved from the Billboard Hot 100s to examine for similarities or differences in the top ranking music genres, songs, and artists for each year from 2014 to 2023. </p>
